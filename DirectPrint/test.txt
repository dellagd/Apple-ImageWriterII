Chapter 1: Meet the ImageWriter II


ImageWriter II Features

The Apple ImageWriter II is the ideal addition to your Apple computer. The versatile ImageWriter II combines ease of operation with a host of high-performance features to produce professional-quality graphics and text printouts. You can expand the ImageWriter II’s capabilities by choosing among three optional accessories—the ImageWriter II SheetFeeder, ImageWriter II 32K Memory Option, and ImageWriter II AppleTalk Option.

Features for Everyone

Do you want presentation quality text for an important report? Do you need to print hundreds of mailing labels? Could you show sales increases more dramatically with a bar chart in your report? Is it time to get that novel off to your publisher? The flexible ImageWriter II easily does all this and more. Consider these features for your day-to-day work.

Print Quality and Speed

You can select from among three levels of print quality at the press of a button: 
Near Letter Quality (NLQ) for formal communications and presentations
Standard Quality for everyday work
Draft Quality when you want a quick printout for review or editing

The ImageWriter II can print high-resolution graphics, ideal for use with the Macintosh and with graphics programs written for the Apple II computers. The ImageWriter II’s high-speed print mechanism can turn out text at speeds up to 250 characters per second.

Letters, Labels, and Forms

The ImageWriter II can handle a variety of printing tasks: reports, letters, envelopes, mailing labels, even multi-part forms like invoices.

Easy Paper Loading and Ribbon Changes

With the automatic paper loading feature, you can load single-sheet paper with the push of a button. Thanks to the built-in forms tractor, the ImageWriter II makes loading computer paper easier than ever before.

Likewise, ribbon changes are a snap. Ribbon cartridges click in and out quickly and neatly. Whether you print in black or color, you get high-quality images and long life from these continuous-loop, fabric ribbons.

Seven-Color Printing

To print color graphics, click in an ImageWriter II color ribbon. With color software, you can print documents in six colors plus black. You can even mix black text with color graphics.
